Upgrading from ir-7.x-1.x to ir-7.x-2.x:

    - The version 7.1-1.x uses a cck field to store the reservation status. This
      is changed from 7.1-2.x to be a separate database table now. If you update
      the module, you have to manually transfer all reservations from the field
      to the new structure by reserving each item again. Afterwards you should
      remove the field.
