This module adds a reservation function to nodes. This serves as a wish list or wedding gift registry.

Dependencies:
=============

This module depence on the token and the content (cck) module.

How to use:
===========

Create a content type that represents a gift item. E.g. create an image field, a link to a shopping url, etc. Most important, create a text field that stores the reservation status.

Activate the ir module (this one).

Go to admin/content/ir and select the content type(s). After saving, configure the module for each content type:

* select the field which stores the status.
* enter a value to be saved when someone reserves that item
* enter a value that should be saved when no one has reserved it
* enter a text with tokens that shows the current status.

Next, configure the permissions for the module by opening admin/user/permissions#module-ir. If you allow anonymous users to reserve items, you should enable the captcha-module and protect the reservation form. Open the captcha settings and add the form id "ir_form" and a captcha.

When you enable taxonomy and create a custom vocabulary, consider to enable the private taxonomy feature: http://drupal.org/project/private_taxonomy
